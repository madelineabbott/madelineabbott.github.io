I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and am co-advised by [Jeremy Taylor](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/taylor-jeremy.html) and [Walter Dempsey](https://walterhdempsey.com/). My research interests include:
+ Methods for analyzing intensive longitudinal data
+ Methods for jointly modeling longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes
+ Statistical approaches for predicting patient outcomes 
+ Applications in cancer research, smoking cessation, and behavioral science 

My dissertation research focuses on the development of joint longitudinal and survival models. This work is motivated by mobile health data from smoking cessation studies. I recieved an [F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10677935) from the NIH to support this work.

I completed the MS program in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in 2020 and received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN.
