I am a Research Associate at the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research ([CBAR](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/biostatistics-aids-cbar/)) in the Harvard School of Public Health.  At CBAR, I work on the design, monitoring, and analysis of clinical trials in the areas of HIV and tuberculosis, collaborating closely with clinicians as part of the [International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network](https://www.impaactnetwork.org/).  Broadly, my research interests include:
+ Methods for analyzing complex longitudinal data
+ Methods for jointly modeling longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes
+ Design and analysis of clinical trials
+ Applications in cancer research, smoking cessation, behavioral science, and infectious disease


I received my PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in 2024, where I was co-advised by [Jeremy Taylor](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/taylor-jeremy.html) and [Walter Dempsey](https://walterhdempsey.com/). My dissertation research focused on the development of joint longitudinal and survival models. This work was motivated by mobile health data from smoking cessation studies. I recieved an [F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10677935) from the NIH to support this work.

I completed the MS program in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan in 2020 and received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN.
